# Vanna Finance
Vanna Finance is a decentralized proprietary trading protocol designed to bring composable leverage to DeFi derivatives. By connecting passive lenders and traders, Vanna Finance provides up to **1000x leverage** on existing DeFi derivative platforms, enabling traders to execute sophisticated hedging and trading strategies with minimal collateral.

## Problem
- While crypto has grown significantly, derivative volumes in DeFi remain low compared to the high volumes in centralized finance (CFI).
- This disparity is due to the lack of adoption among retail traders, driven by limited access to liquidity and the absence of user-friendly position management dashboards.
- In the traditional financial world, a significant portion of derivative trading volume is generated by proprietary trading firms.

## Solution
- Our approach involves connecting two groups: traders who lack liquidity and passive lenders who have liquidity but lack trading expertise.
  - **Liquidity Providers:** Supply liquidity unilaterally, similar to platforms like AAVE and Compound, and earn passive APY without risking permanent loss.
  - **Leverage Takers:** Borrow this liquidity with minimal collateral (10x leverage) to use in existing DeFi options/futures protocols and equity markets to execute hedging strategies like Covered Call, short Gamma, etc., enabling more dynamic and flexible trading opportunities.
- By grouping them together, we can leverage the strengths of both parties.
- Additionally, we will provide a trader-friendly position monitoring dashboard to leverage takers to enhance their trading efficiency and decision-making.
- Every action of the trader or liquidity borrower goes through Vanna Finance's predefined rules to maintain protocol solvency.

## Key Features
- **Composable Leverage:** Traders can access up to **1000x leverage** and utilize it across various DeFi derivatives like options, futures, and perpetuals.
